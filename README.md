# QUake-MD GUI

QUake-MD GUI creates an graphical interface between the user and the QUake-MD tool. QUake-MD tool estimates a weighted space of magnitude (M), depth (H) and epicentral intensity (Io) for historical earthquakes based on intensity data points (IDPs), associated quality factors and empirical intensity prediction equations (IPE). The weighted space of M/H/Io aims to be representative of the IDPs and their quality and of IPE epistemic uncertainties.
QUake-MD GUI offers in addition an intensity data visualization tool.

## Getting started

QUake-MD GUI uses python scientific libraries. It is recommended tu use a complete scientific Python distribution.
Recommended distribution is:
  - Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com)
